# Clean Architecture

## Description

This repository intents to sumarize the basis of Clean Architecture, to get a quick overview of concepts or a document to come back if you have any doubts.

## Bibliography

* [Clean Architecture - by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture)
* [Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices - by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84985.Agile_Software_Development_Principles_Patterns_and_Practices)

## How To Use

* Bottom-up organization, start from first modules if you want to learn from scratch.
* A basic understanding of programming concepts will be helpful but is not needed
* Each module ends with a "Conclusion" section that provides a quick overview, you can jump straight to this if you want a quick reminder and you feel like you already know the topic.
* I strongly recommend further research on the latest and more practical modules, as I don't provide lots of examples but more the theorical basis you need, be proactive.

## WIP

This repository is actively being updated, this status will change once I consider I've already cover all minimal concepts from Clean Architecture to allow anyone who reads this to have all the material required to learn this from scratch, at disposal
