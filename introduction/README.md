# Introduction

## Software Architecture

Large software constructs are made from smaller software components, which are in turn made of smaller software components still, and so on.

When we talk about software architecture, software is recursive and fractal in nature, etched
and sketched in code.

Time, money, and effort give us a sense of how we can determine whether an architecture is good or not: Not only does a good architecture meet the needs of its users, developers and owners at a given point in time, but it also meets them over time.

The kinds of changes a system's development typically experiences should not be the changes that are costly, that are hard to make, that take managed projects of their own rather than being folded into daily and weekly flow of work.

How do we know what those typical changes will be so that we can shape those significant decisions around them? How do we reduce future development effort and costs?

> Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, but that you are not necessarily more likely to get them right than any other - Ralph Johnson

Road forks many ways...

#### Rigid architectures

The idea that that strong and stable architecture comes from authority and rigidity. If change is expensive, change is eliminated.

#### Speculative architectures

Route filled with hard-coded guesswork, countless parameters, tombs of dead code, and more accidental complexity than you can shake a maintenance budget at.

#### Clean Architecture

This is the path we are interested in.

It recognizes that we operate with incomplete knowledge, but it also understands that, as humans, operating with incomplete knowledge is something we're good at. We ask questions and we run experiments.

A good architecture comes from understanding it more as a journey than as a destination, more as an ongoing process of enquiry than as a frozen artifact.
